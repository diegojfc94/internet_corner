## Resume
I love developing anything that solves real problems for users, in any industry or sector.

I've been working since 2016 when I began as an intern in my last year of university.

I have been working on the whole technology stack, although in the last 3 years I have been focused on the more visual section, close to the user because since I started in the programming world, it is the one that brought me more curiosity from the beginning.

Currently, in late 2024 May, I´m learning React with Next.js, to get new opportunities outside the Angular ecosystem and get out of my comfort zone.

## Frontend Engineer (2021 - Now)
Now, I´m working on a PWA and Control Center project with Hexagonal Architecture in the Photovoltaic industry.
